# Clustering
Clustering is a form of unsupervised machine learning in which observations are grouped into clusters based on similarities in their data values, or features. This kind of machine learning is considered unsupervised because it doesn't make use of previously known label values to train a model. In a clustering model, the label is the cluster to which the observation is assigned, based only on its features.

## Evaluating a clustering model
Since there's no known label with which to compare the predicted cluster assignments, evaluation of a clustering model is based on how well the resulting clusters are separated from one another.

There are multiple metrics that you can use to evaluate cluster separation, including:

- Average distance to cluster center: How close, on average, each point in the cluster is to the centroid of the cluster.
- Average distance to other center: How close, on average, each point in the cluster is to the centroid of all other clusters.
- Maximum distance to cluster center: The furthest distance between a point in the cluster and its centroid.
- Silhouette: A value between -1 and 1 that summarizes the ratio of distance between points in the same cluster and points in different clusters (The closer to 1, the better the cluster separation).
